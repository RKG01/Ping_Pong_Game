To deploy your Pong game (or any static HTML/CSS/JS project), here are some simple options:

1. GitHub Pages (Recommended for static sites)
Commit your files (index.html, style.css, game.js) to a GitHub repository.
Go to your repository on GitHub.
Click on Settings > Pages in the sidebar.
Under Build and deployment, set Source to your main branch (and /root if it asks for a folder).
Save and wait for the URL (it will be something like https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/).
Visit the URL to play your game!
2. Netlify or Vercel (Easy static deployment)
Go to Netlify or Vercel.
Connect your GitHub repository and deploy. They will provide you a live link.
3. Local deployment (for testing)
Place all files in the same folder.
Open index.html in your browser.
For some browsers, you might need to serve with a local server (e.g. python -m http.server in the folder) to avoid CORS issues.
